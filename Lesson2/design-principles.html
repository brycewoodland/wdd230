            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <a href="https://crumblcookies.com/">Crumbl</a>
            <p><img src="images/crumbl.png" alt="pictureOfCrumbl"></p>
            <p>Visual Hierarchy refers to the arrangement of
                the elements on the webpage based on importance.
                The purpose is to guide the observers eye to
                areas of the page you wish your viewer to see. 
                Some key aspects that help visual hierarchy
                include size, color, spacing, contrast, alignment,
                etc. Crumbl does a good job at visual hierarchy
                by attracting attention to the cookies 
                they are tyring to sell right at the top
                of their page. They utilize images to
                draw your attention to cookies that will
                interest you. They use actual pictures of
                their cookies that make a z pattern, taking 
                your eyes from the picture to the name and
                description.</p>

            <h3>PARC: Repitition</h3>
            <a href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>
            <p><img src="images/Screenshot 2023-09-22 112815.png" alt="pictureOfNetflix"></p>
            <p>PARC refers to proximity, alignment, repetition
                and contrast. Repitition in a website helps to
                unify the layout and make the website appear
                consistent. It helps to avoid confusion and 
                disgust by relying on the same colors, fonts, 
                spacing or heading. Netflix does a good job on
                this aspect. Their movies and tv shows are laid 
                out the same way. By doing this it allows users 
                of their website to quickly and efficiently find
                things they want to watch. This design makes it 
                user friendly and avoids frustration from the user.
                When the user is able to find certain things it
                makes the user want to keep using their website.</p>

            <h3>PARC: Contrast</h3>
            <a href="https://www.target.com/">Target</a>
            <p><img src="images/target.png" alt="pictureOfTarget"></p>
            <p>For some areas, repetition and staying
                consistent is important. However, when striving
                to emphasize the difference between two items
                it's important to use contrast. Contrast needs
                to be used especially within text and background. 
                If the colors are the same the viewer won't be able 
                to read your website. Target does a good job at 
                using various colors that demonstrate various seasons
                and holidays. This will help the viewer understand
                and grasp quickly what Target is selling at the moment.
                The halloween items have a background color of purple. 
                Whereas, the autumn items use different shades of tans 
                and browns. Everything on their page is well designed 
                and easy to read.
