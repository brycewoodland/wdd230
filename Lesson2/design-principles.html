            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p><a href="#"></a></p>
            <p><img src="#" alt="pictureOfWebsite"></p>
            <p>Visual Hierarchy refers to the arrangement of
                the elements on the webpage based on importance.
                The purpose is to guide the observers eye to
                areas of the page you wish your viewer to see. 
                Some key aspects that help visual hierarchy
                include size, color, spacing, contrast, alignment,
                etc.</p>

            <h3>PARC: Repitition</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p><a href="#"></a></p>
            <p><img src="#" alt="pictureOfWebsite"></p>
            <p>PARC refers to proximity, alignment, repetition
                and contrast. Repitition in a website helps to
                unify the layout and make the website appear
                consistent. It helps to avoid confusion and 
                disgust by relying on the same colors, fonts, 
                or heading.</p>

            <h3>PARC: Contrast</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p><a href="#"></a></p>
            <p><img src="#" alt="pictureOfWebsite"></p>
            <p>For some areas, repition and staying
                consistent is important. However, when striving
                to emphasize the difference between to items
                it's important to use contrast. Contrast needs
                to be used especially within text and background. 
                If the colors are the same the viewer won't be able 
                to read your website.
